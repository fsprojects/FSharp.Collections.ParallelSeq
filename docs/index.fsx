F# Parallel Sequences
===================

This library provides an F#-style API for the parallel operations on sequences from the
System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable class in .NET 4.0. The API is akin to F# operations on sequences.

      The F# FSharp.Collections.ParallelSeq library can be <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Collections.ParallelSeq">installed from NuGet</a>:

Example
-------

This example demonstrates the use of a function defined in this library.

*)
#r "FSharp.Collections.ParallelSeq.dll"
open FSharp.Collections.ParallelSeq

let nums = [|1..500000|]

let isPrime n = 
    let upperBound = int (sqrt (float n))
    let hasDivisor =     
        [2..upperBound]
        |> List.exists (fun i -> n % i = 0)
    not hasDivisor
        
let finalDigitOfPrimes = 
        nums 
        |> PSeq.filter isPrime
        |> PSeq.groupBy (fun i -> i % 10)
        |> PSeq.map (fun (k, vs) -> (k, Seq.length vs))
        |> PSeq.toArray
